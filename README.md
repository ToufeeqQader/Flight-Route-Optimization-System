# Skynet – Intelligent Route Planning System

# Project Overview
Skynet is a C++ Qt-based desktop application designed to simulate and optimize route planning under multiple constraints such as distance, weather conditions, and scheduling priorities. The system integrates routing algorithms, weather simulation, and multi-criteria optimization to assist in intelligent decision-making.
